# GPUI and Websockets

Messing around with [GPUI](https://gpui.rs) and Websockets. Not really sure what i'm doing or if it's correct. But it's fun.

## Getting Started

`ws-server` is a simple websocket server that listens on port 3030. It will broadcast any message it receives to all listeners on the `/chat` endpoint.

`chat` is a simple window that displays the lastest chat that has been received from the server.
